# Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make 
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## 3. Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take 
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, 
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently 
any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the 
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail 
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or 
offline event.

## 5. Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project 
team at opensource[at]hudsonthames.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
