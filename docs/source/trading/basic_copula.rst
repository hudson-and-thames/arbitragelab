Basic Copula Trading Strategy
=============================

.. Note::
    The following strategy closely follows the implementations:

    `Pairs trading: a copula approach. (2013) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jdhf.2013.1>`__ by Liew, Rong Qi, and Yuan Wu.

    `Trading strategies with copulas. (2013) <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318054326>`__ by Stander, Yolanda, DaniÃ«l Marais, and Ilse Botha.

The trading strategy using copula is implemented as a long-short pairs trading scheme, and uses rules from the general
long-short pairs trading framework.

Conditional Probabilities
#########################

We start with a pair of stocks of interest :math:`S_1` and :math:`S_2`, which can be selected by various methods.
For example, using the Engle-Granger test for cointegration.
By consensus, we define the spread as :math:`S_1` in relation to :math:`S_2`.
e.g. Short the spread means buying :math:`S_1` and/or selling :math:`S_2`.

Use **prices** data of the stocks during the training/formation period, we proceed with a pseudo-MLE
fit to establish a copula that reflects the relation of the two stocks during the training/formation period.

Then we can calculate the **conditional probabilities** using trading/testing period data:

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2), \\
    P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1).
    \end{align}

- :math:`u_i \in [0, 1]` is the quantile of trading period data mapped by a CDF formed in the training period.

- When :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) < 0.5`, then stock 1 is considered under-valued.

- When :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) > 0.5`, then stock 1 is considered over-valued.

Trading Logic
#############

Now we define an upper threshold :math:`b_{up}` (e.g. 0.95) and a lower threshold :math:`b_{lo}` (e.g. 0.05),
then the logic is as follows:

- If :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) \le b_{lo}` and :math:`P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1) \ge b_{up}`, then stock 1 is
  undervalued, and stock 2 is overvalued. Hence we long the spread. ( :math:`1` in position)

- If :math:`P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1) \le b_{lo}` and :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) \ge b_{up}`, then stock 2 is
  undervalued, and stock 1 is overvalued. Hence we short the spread. ( :math:`-1` in position)

- If both/either conditional probabilities cross the boundary of :math:`0.5`, then we exit the position, as we consider
  the position no longer valid. ( :math:`0` in position)

Ambiguities and Comments
************************

The authors did not specify what will happen if the followings occur:

1. When there is an open signal and an exit signal.
    
2. When there is an open signal and currently there is a position.
    
3. When there is a long and short signal together.

Here is our take:

1. Exit signal overrides open signal.

2. Flip the position to the signal's suggestion. For example, originally have a short position, and receives a long
   signal, then the position becomes long.
   
3. Technically this should never happen with the default trading logic. However, if it did happen for whatever
   reason, long + short signal will lead to no opening signal and the positions will not change, unless there is
   an exit signal and that resets the position to 0.

For exiting a position, the authors proposed using **'and'** logic: Both conditional probabilities need to cross :math:`0.5`.
However, we found this too strict and sometimes fails to exit a position when it should. Therefore we also provide the
**'or'** logic: At least one of the conditional probabilities cross :math:`0.5`.

Implementation
##############

.. Note::
    The new :code:`BasicCopulaTradingRule` class is created to allow on-the-go generation of trading signals and
    better management of opened and closed positions. It is a refactored version of the old :code:`BasicCopulaStrategy`
    class that worked as a monolith, outputting trading signals for a pandas DataFrame. The new class takes price
    values one by one and generates signals to enter or exit the trade, making its integration into an existing
    trading pipeline easier.
