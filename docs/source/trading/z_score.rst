Introduction
############

The Hedge Ratios module, alongside the Spread Selection and ML Based Pairs Selection modules, helps find assets
for a well-performing strategy and construct spreads. The current module provides strategies to use on the
constructed spreads.

The trading strategies presented in this section follow a different signal generation logic than that proposed in
the previous classes of the ArbitrageLab package. These trading strategies take new spread values one by one and allow
checking if the conditions to open a position are fulfilled with each new timestamp and value provided. This allows
for easier integration of these strategies into an existing data pipeline. Also, the strategy object keeps track
of open and closed trades and the supporting information related to them.

Bollinger Bands Strategy
########################

By using the Bollinger bands on the Z-scores from the provided spread, we can construct a trading strategy.
The Z-score is calculated as a normalized deviation of the spread value from its moving average.
The formula can be written as follows:

.. math::

    Zscore_{t} = \frac{S_{t} - MA(S_{t}, T_{MA})}{std(S_{t}, T_{std})}

Where:

- :math:`S_{t}` is the spread value at time :math:`t`.

- :math:`MA(S_{t}, T_{MA})` is the moving average of the spread calculated
  using a backward-looking :math:`T_{MA}` window.

- :math:`std(S_{t}, T_{std})` is the rolling standard deviation of the spread
  calculated using a backward-looking :math:`T_{std}` window.

The idea is to enter a position only when the spread deviates by more than *entryZscore* standard deviations
from the mean (:math:`|Zscore_{t}| >= |entryZscore|`). This parameter can be optimized in a training set.

Also, the look-back windows for calculating the mean and the standard deviation are the parameters that
can be optimized. We can later exit the strategy when the spread changes its value by more than *exitZscore_delta*
from the *entryZscore* in the opposite direction(:math:`|Zscore_{t}| <= |entryZscore + exitZscore\_delta|`).

If the look-back window is short and we set a small *entryZscore* and *exitZscore_delta*, the holding period
will be shorter and we get more round trip trades and generally higher profits.

The strategy object is initialized with a window for a simple moving average, a window for
simple moving st. deviation, and entry and exit label Z-Scores.

The ``update_spread_value`` method allows adding new spread values one by one - when they are available.
At each stage, the ``check_entry_signal`` method checks if the trade should be entered according to the
above-described logic. If the trade should be opened, it can be added to the internal dictionary using the
``add_trade`` method.

As well, the ``update_trades`` method can be used to check if any trades should be closed.
If so, the internal dictionaries are updated, and the list of the closed trades at this stage is returned.

.. code-block::

    # Importing packages

    import numpy as np

    # Tools to construct and trade spread
    from arbitragelab.hedge_ratios import construct_spread
    from arbitragelab.trading import BollingerBandsTradingRule

    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=[0])
    hedge_ratios = pd.Series({'A': 1, 'AVB': 0.832406370860649})
    spread = construct_spread(self.data[['AVB', 'A']], hedge_ratios=hedge_ratios)

    # Creating a strategy
    strategy = BollingerBandsTradingRule(sma_window=20, std_window=20,
                                         entry_z_score=2.5, exit_z_score_delta=3)

    # Adding initial spread value
    strategy.update_spread_value(spread[0])

    # Feeding spread values to the strategy one by one
    for time, value in spread.iteritems():
        strategy.update_spread_value(value)

        # Checking if logic for opening a trade is triggered
        trade, side = strategy.check_entry_signal()

        # Adding a trade if we decide to trade signal
        if trade:
            strategy.add_trade(start_timestamp=time, side_prediction=side)

        # Update trades, close if logic is triggered
        close = strategy.update_trades(update_timestamp=time)

    # Checking currently open trades
    open_trades = strategy.open_trades

    # Checking all closed trades
    closed_trades = strategy.closed_trades
