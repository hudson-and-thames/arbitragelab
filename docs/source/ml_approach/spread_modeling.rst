Introduction
############

In this module, we are following the works of Dr Christian Dunis and co-authors relating to
the efficient modeling of a few major commodity spreads. The main attributes of trading spreads
are:

Advantages 
**********

- **Less likely to suffer from information shocks**

It is important to note that spreads are less likely to suffer from information shocks, 
as the movements of the two legs  will offset each other.

- **Less likely to be subject to speculative bubbles**

`(Sweeney 1988) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2331068>`_ notes that speculative bubbles are a big source of market 
inefficiency. This effect is less likely to happen in spread markets because any
bubble effect will be replicated in the opposing leg of the spread (assuming
the two legs are sufficiently correlated). Therefore, the effect of the bubble is largely offset.

Disadvantages
*************

- **Limited Return Potential**

The spreads are hard to trade since they offer a limited potential return because of the muted
effect of market inefficiencies. This is also exacerbated by the fact that two sets of transaction costs
have to be covered in order to trade a spread. 

- **Transaction costs for multiple legs**

A point made by `(Butterworth and Holmes 2002) <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09603100110044236>`_ that ‘the overall profitability
of the strategy is seriously impaired by the difficulty, which traders face, in liquidating
their positions’ indicates a definite need for more discerning trade selection which is 
solved using an assortment of filters.

In the literature, the initial motivation of the works was to model and forecast the spread
as accurately as possible. As time progressed, the literature started focusing more on
seeking models/methods that discriminated between large/small moves, so that transaction
costs would be minimized.
